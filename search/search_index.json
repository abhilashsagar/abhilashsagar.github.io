I wanted to prove that we can build our own \u2014 from the ground up \u2014 using parts available locally, and learn how Linux truly runs on bare metal in the process.</p> <p>That\u2019s how Kaage Pi was born: a home-soldered board built around the Allwinner V3s, an ARM Cortex-A7 SoC with 64 MB of integrated DDR2 RAM \u2014 powerful enough to boot Linux without any external memory.</p> <p>This project isn\u2019t about competing with Raspberry Pi. It\u2019s about understanding, experimenting, and inspiring others to start their own journey in open hardware \u2014 where you can hold a running Linux system that you built with your own hands.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve ever wondered \u201cCan I really make my own Linux board?\u201d \u2014 the answer is yes, you can. Start small, stay patient, and let curiosity lead.</p> <p>This page documents the journey \u2014 from loose components on my desk to a working Linux shell prompt.</p>"},{"location":"kaagepi/#future-work","title":"Future Work","text":"<ul> <li>Bring-up the LCD (Parallel RGB)  </li> <li>Enable Ethernet PHY and ping from Linux  </li> <li>Port LVGL on framebuffer   </li> <li>Work on SPI NOR flash </li> </ul>"},{"location":"kaagepi/#resources-tutorials-that-helped","title":"Resources &amp; Tutorials That Helped","text":"<p>I learned a lot from open-source communities and amazing YouTube creators while building Kaage Pi.
